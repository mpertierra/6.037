;; Using the clock:
;;
;; When you want the object to start being aware of the clock
;; (during initialization of autonomous-person, for example),
;; add a callback to the clock which activates a method on the
;; object:
;; (our-clock 'ADD-CALLBACK
;;      (new clock-callback 'thingy self 'DO-THINGY))
;; The first argument is a name or descriptor of the callback.
;; The second argument is the object to which to send the message.
;; The third argument is the message (method-name) to send.
;; Additional arguments can be provided and they are sent to
;; the object with the message when the callback is activated.
;; In this case, the method do-thingy should be descriptive of
;; the behavior the object will exhibit when time passes.
;; When the object's lifetime expires (sometimes this is taken
;; literally!), it should remove its callback(s) from the clock.
;; This can be done with
;; (our-clock 'REMOVE-CALLBACK
;;      self 'thingy)
;;
;; An example of using callback names and additional arguments:
;; (our-clock 'ADD-CALLBACK
;;      (new clock-callback 'whoopee me 'SAY '("Whoopee!")))
;; (our-clock 'ADD-CALLBACK
;;      (new clock-callback 'fun me 'SAY '("I am having fun!")))
;; This causes the avatar to say two things every time the clock
;; ticks.
